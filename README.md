# Code snippet manager

## About
### What is this project about? I was tired of digging through github or my files to find code snippets to use in my current projects so I made this.
### This web application stores all the code snippets I need all in one place, and allows me to copy them easily.
### The code is stored in local storage for now but I will be trying to use a database to reliably store everything in the future, I hope you enjoy it.
